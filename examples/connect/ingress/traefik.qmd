# Configuring Posit Connect with Traefik Ingress

This example deploys Posit Connect with an Ingress using the Traefik Ingress Controller.
This example is provided to show how to set annotations to enabled session affinity and to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
The Traefik Ingress Controller has a variety of settings and modes of operation. 
Please visit the Traefik documentation for more details specific to your use case:
https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/

The focus of this example is on Traefik Ingress setup, however there are a few # requirements to run Connect.
To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage and a PostgreSQL database.

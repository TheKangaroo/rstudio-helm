# This example deploys RStudio Package Manager with a single PersistentVolume 
# backed by an NFS server
#
# The PersistentVolume allows setting NFS mountOptions
# it creates a storage class that RStudio Package Manager then takes advantage # of when it creates its PersistentVolumeClaim.
#
# Both the PVC and PV will be left around after the helm release is removed
# (for manual cleanup)
#
# The focus of this example is on setting up a PV backed by NFS, however there
# are a few requirements to run Workbench.
# To use the example you will need a license file or key,
# a PostgreSQL database and either a ReadWriteMany
# POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage or S3.

# Using a license file with the helm chart:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-file
# If you would like to use a license key see this documentation:
# https://github.com/rstudio/helm/tree/main/charts/rstudio-workbench#license-key

  file:
    secret: posit-licenses # TODO: Change to the secret name in your cluster
    secretKey: workbench.lic # TODO: Change to the secret key containing your Workbench license

sharedStorage:
  create: true
  mount: true
  storageClassName: nfs-pm-sharedstorage-pv # TODO: Ensure this name matches the name and storageClassName defined in the PV created below in extraObjects.
  # volumeName: pm-shared-pv-name # Only needed if PVs have been statically provisioned, in which case this will need to match the PV name.
  requests:
    storage: 100G

# This is evaluated as a template
# Change the `mountOptions` and `nfs` settings to suite your NFS setup

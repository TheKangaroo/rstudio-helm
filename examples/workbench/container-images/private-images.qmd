# Configuring Posit Workbench to Access Authenticated Image Registries

This example deploys Posit Workbench using custom images in registries requiring authentication instead of the default public Posit provided images.
Both the Workbench and session container images may be customized in the helm chart to pull from your own container registry instead of the public Posit provided images.
This example also shows where to provide private registry credentials in the form of a Kubernetes secret of type `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`.
 
Note the registry credentials secret must be specified in two places in the values to apply to Workbench and session containers (shown in the example below).

```{.yaml include="rstudio-workbench-custom-image-private.yaml" filename="values.yaml"}
```

# RStudio Workbench

![Version: 0.4.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.4.6-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 1.4.1717-3](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-1.4.1717--3-informational?style=flat-square)

#### _Official Helm chart for RStudio Workbench_

Data Scientists use [RStudio Workbench](https://www.rstudio.com/products/workbench/) to analyze data and create data
products using R and Python.

## Disclaimer

> This chart is "beta" quality. It will likely undergo
> breaking changes without warning as it moves towards stability.

As a result, please:
* Ensure you "pin" the version of the Helm chart that you are using. You can do
  this using the `helm dependency` command and the associated "Chart.lock" files
  or the `--version` flag. IMPORTANT: This protects you from breaking changes
* Before upgrading, to avoid breaking changes, use `helm diff upgrade` to check
  for breaking changes
* Pay close attention to [`NEWS.md`](./NEWS.md) for updates on breaking
  changes, as well as documentation below on how to use the chart

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` at version 0.4.6:

```bash
helm repo add rstudio https://helm.rstudio.com
helm install my-release rstudio/rstudio-workbench --version=0.4.6
```

## Required Configuration

This chart requires the following in order to function:

* A license key, license file, or address of a running license server. See the `license` configuration below.
* A Kubernetes [PersistentVolume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) that contains the home directory for users.
  * If `homeStorage.create` is set, a PVC that relies on the default storage class will be created to generate the PersistentVolume.
    Most Kubernetes environments do not have a default storage class that you can use with `ReadWriteMany` access mode out-of-the-box.
    In this case, we recommend you disable `homeStorage.create` and  create your own `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim`, then mount them
    into the container by specifying the `pod.volumes` and `pod.volumeMounts` parameters, or by specifying your `PersistentVolumeClaim` using `homeStorage.name` and `homeStorage.mount`.
  * If you cannot use a `PersistentVolume` to properly mount your users' home directories, you'll need to mount your data in the container
    by using a regular [Kubernetes Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs), specified in `pod.volumes` and `pod.volumeMounts`.
  * If you cannot use a `Volume` to mount the directories, you'll need to manually mount them during container startup  with a mechanism similar to what
    is described below for joining to auth domains.
  * If not using `homeStorage.create`, you'll need to configure `config.serverDcf.launcher-mounts` to ensure that the correct mounts are used when users create new sessions.
* If using load balancing (by setting `replicas > 1`), you will need similar storage defined for `sharedStorage` to store shared project configuration.
* A method to join the deployed `rstudio-workbench` container to your auth domain. The default `rstudio/rstudio-server-pro` image does not contain a way to join domains.
  We recommend creating your own Docker image that derives from this base image to provide domain joining that fits your needs. Your image can then use a process supervisor
  like [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) to run multiple processes: in the most common case, `rstudio-server`, `rstudio-launcher`, and `sssd`. See
  [here](https://github.com/rstudio/sol-eng-demo-server/tree/main/helper/workbench) for an example of this.

## Recommended Configuration

In addition to the above required configuration, we recommend setting the following to ensure a reliable deployment:

* Set the `launcherPem` value to ensure that it stays the same between releases.
  This will ensure that users can continue to properly connect to older sessions even after a redeployment of the chart. See the
  [RSW Admin Guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/job-launcher.html#authentication) for details on generating the file.
* Set the `global.secureCookieKey` so that user authentication continues to work between deployments. A valid value can be obtained
  by simply running the `uuid` command.
* Some use-cases may require special PAM profiles to run. By default, no PAM profiles other than the basic `auth` profile will be used to authenticate users.
  If this is not sufficient then you will need to add your PAM profiles into the container (similar to adding `sssd.conf` as specified above).

## General Principles

- In most places, we opt to pass Helm values directly into ConfigMaps. We translate these into the valid `.ini` or `.dcf` file formats
required by RStudio Workbench. Those config files and their mount locations are below.
- If you need to modify the jobs launched by RStudio Workbench, you want to use `job-json-overrides`. There is a section on this below
  and [a support article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051652094-Using-Job-Json-Overrides-with-RStudio-Server-Pro-and-Kubernetes)
  on the topic in general.
- If you are running in an HA environment, there is [an experimental sidecar container](https://hub.docker.com/r/colearendt/rstudio-load-balancer-manager)
  that maintains the `load-balancer` file and HUPs the rstudio-server service.
- The prestart script for RStudio Workbench is highly customized to:
  - Get the service account information off of the RStudio Workbench pod for use in launching jobs
  - Generate `launcher.pub` as needed (if `launcher.pem` is provided). If it is not provided,
  the Helm chart will generate it automatically but this information will be lost for subsequent deployments and
  can cause users to be locked out sessions started by a previous deployment.
- RStudio Workbench does not export prometheus metrics on its own. Instead, we run a sidecar graphite exporter
  [as described here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044800273-Monitoring-RStudio-Team-Using-Prometheus-and-Graphite)

## Configuration files

These configuration values all take the form of usual helm values
so you can set the database password with something like:

```
... --set config.secret.database\.conf.password=mypassword ...
```

The files are converted into configuration files in the necessary format via go-templating.

The names of files are dynamically used, so you can usually add new files as needed. Beware that
some files have default values, so moving them can have adverse effects. Also, if you use a different
mounting paradigm, you will need to change the `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` environment variable

- Session Configuration
  - These configuration files are mounted into the server and
    will ideally be mounted into the session pods as well.
  - `repos.conf`, `rsession.conf`, `notifications.conf`
  - located in the `config.session.<< name of file >>` helm values
  - mounted at `/mnt/session-configmap/rstudio/`
- Secret Configuration
  - These configuration files are mounted into the server with more restrictive permissions
  - `database.conf`, `launcher.pem`
  - They are located in the `config.secret.<< name of file >>` helm values
  - mounted at `/mnt/secret-configmap/rstudio/`
- Server Configuration
  - These configuration files are mounted into the server (.ini file format)
  - `rserver.conf`, `launcher.conf`, `jupyter.conf`, `launcher.kubernetes.profiles.conf`, `logging.conf`
  - They are located at `config.server.<< name of file >>` helm values
  - mounted at `/mnt/configmap/rstudio/`
- Server DCF Configuration
  - These configuration files are mounted into the server (.dcf file format)
  - `launcher-mounts`, `launcher-env`
  - They are located at `config.serverDcf.<< name of file >>` helm values
  - included at `/mnt/configmap/rstudio/`
- Load Balancer file
  - If `replicas > 1` then we create and maintain a load balancer file at `/mnt/load-balancer/rstudio/`
  - This is maintained by [a sidecar](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/rstudio-server-load-balancer-manager)
  that queries the Kubernetes API for other RStudio pods
- Prestart
  - This is provided by the helm chart in a configmap
  - It is mounted into the pod at `/scripts/`
- Job Json Overrides
  - If you want to customize the job launch process, you will need to edit a few items:
    - Set the `job-json-overrides` config values in `config.server.launcher\.kubernetes\.profiles\.conf`
    - Set the `jobJsonOverridesFiles` helm value to be a map of files, which are translated verbatim from YAML to JSON
    - These are written to `/mnt/job-json-overrides/<< key / file name >>`

# Application Configuration

This example deploys RStudio Connect with the recommended application
configuration.

These settings are recommend for most deployments and are described below:

- Set replicas > 1 to deploy Connect load balanced across multiple pods: https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/load-balancing/
- Set a default Posit Package Manager CRAN URL: https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/r/package-management/#configuring-on-posit-connect
- Set a default Posit Package Manager PyPI URL: https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/python/package-management/#configuring-pip
- Enable Quarto content: https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/quarto/#enabling-quarto-support


The focus of this example is on best practice application
configuration, however there are a few requirements to run Connect.
To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany
POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage and a PostgreSQL database.

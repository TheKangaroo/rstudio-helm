## Upgrade Guidance

### 0.4.0

- When upgrading to version 0.4.0 or later, the Package Manager service moves from running as `root` to running as
  the `rstudio-pm` user (with `uid:gid` `999:999`)
- This can cause problems with file ownership when using a Persistent Volume Claim or other persistent directory
- This can also be at-odds with your configuration if you set / copied / persisted values
  like `config.Launcher.ServerUser = root`. We added a check for this setup and a `rootCheckIsFatal` value to disable 
  the check if needed. You should only disable this check if you have good reason to do so.
- To handle the migration of existing data owned by `root`, there is now a Helm hook that essentially runs chown on the
  data directory every time a user runs `helm upgrade`. Unfortunately, we can't detect when we actually need to run this
  migration, so it currently runs unconditionally. The rook only runs when a PersistentVolumeClaim is being used for
  Package Manager storage. The hook can be disabled by setting `enableMigrations=false`; in the future when we no longer
  expect users to have root-owned data, this will become the default.
- If you are using a `volume` directly, you will need to run such a migration yourself. It is basically just a
  recursive `chown`

## Required Configuration

This chart requires the following in order to function:

* A license key, license file, or address of a running license server. See the `license` configuration below.
* A Kubernetes [PersistentVolume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) that contains the data directory for RSPM.
  * If `sharedStorage.create` is set, a PVC that relies on the default storage class will be created to generate the PersistentVolume. 
    Most Kubernetes environments do not have a default storage class that you can use with `ReadWriteMany` access mode out-of-the-box. 
    In this case, we recommend you disable `sharedStorage.create` and create your own `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim`, then 
    mount them into the container by specifying the `pod.volumes` and `pod.volumeMounts` parameters, or by specifying your `PersistentVolumeClaim` using `sharedStorage.name` and `sharedStorage.mount`.
  * If you cannot use a `PersistentVolume` to properly mount your data directory, you'll need to mount your data in the container
    by using a regular [Kubernetes Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes), specified in `pod.volumes` and `pod.volumeMounts`.
  * Alternatively, S3 storage can be used. See the next section for details.

## S3 Configuration

Package Manager [can be configured to store its data in S3
buckets](https://docs.rstudio.com/rspm/admin/files-directories/#data-destinations),
which eliminates the need to provision shared storage for multiple replicas. A
`values.yaml` file using S3 might contain something like the following:

``` yaml
config:
  Storage:
    Default: s3
  S3Storage:
    Bucket: your-s3-bucket
```

If you are running on EKS, we strongly suggest using [IAM Roles for Service
Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)
to manage the credentials needed to access S3. In this scenario, once you have
[created an IAM
role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-service-account-iam-policy-and-role.html),
you can use this role as an annotation on the existing Service Account:

``` yaml
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789000:role/iam-role-name-here
```

If you are unable to use IAM Roles for Service Accounts, there are any number of
alternatives for injecting AWS credentials into a container. As a fallback, the
chart supports setting static credentials:

``` yaml
awsAccessKeyId: your-access-key-id
awsSecretAccessKey: your-secret-access-key
```

Bear in mind that static, long-lived credentials are the least secure option and
should be avoided if at all possible.

## General Principles

- In most places, we opt to pass helm values over configmaps. We translate these into the valid `.gcfg` file format
required by {{ template "chart.name" . }}.

## Configuration File

The configuration values all take the form of usual helm values
so you can set the database password with something like:

```
... --set config.Postgres.Password=mypassword ...
```

The Helm `config` values are converted into the `rstudio-pm.gcfg` service configuration file via go-templating.

## For Production

To ensure a stable production deployment, please:

* Ensure you "pin" the version of the Helm chart that you are using. You can do
  this using the `helm dependency` command and the associated "Chart.lock" files
  or the `--version` flag. **IMPORTANT: This protects you from breaking changes**
* Before upgrading, to avoid breaking changes, use `helm diff upgrade` to check
  for breaking changes
* Pay close attention to [`NEWS.md`](./NEWS.md) for updates on breaking
  changes, as well as documentation below on how to use the chart

{{- end }}

## Best Practices

Helm charts are very useful tools for deploying resources into Kubernetes, however, they do require
some familiarity with kubernetes and `helm` itself. Please ensure you have adequate training and
IT support before deploying these charts into production environments. Reach out to your account representative
if you need help deciding whether helm is a good choice for your deployment.

To ensure reproducibility in your environment and insulate yourself from future changes, please:

* Ensure you "pin" the version of the Helm chart that you are using. You can do
  this using the `helm dependency` command and the associated "Chart.lock" files
  or the `--version` flag. **IMPORTANT: This protects you from breaking changes**
* Before upgrading, to avoid breaking changes, use the `helm-diff` plugin and `helm diff upgrade` to check
  for breaking changes
* Read [`NEWS.md`](./NEWS.md) for updates on breaking
  changes, as well as documentation below on how to use the chart

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` at version {{ template "chart.version" . }}:

```bash
helm repo add rstudio https://helm.rstudio.com
{{- if not $isDev }}
helm upgrade --install my-release rstudio/{{ template "chart.name" . }} --version={{ template "chart.version" . }}
{{- else }}
# to install latest release (NOTE: `--version` flag still recommended!)
helm upgrade --install my-release rstudio/{{ template "chart.name" . }}

# WARNING: to install devel version / release candidate / etc.
helm upgrade --install --devel my-release rstudio/{{ template "chart.name" . }} --version={{ template "chart.version" . }}
{{- end }}
```

To explore other chart versions, take a look at:
```
helm search repo {{ if $isDev }}--devel {{ end }}rstudio/{{ template "chart.name" . }} -l
```

{{- end }}

# Configuring Posit Package Manager with an NFS-backed `PersistentVolume`

This example deploys Posit Package Manager with a single `PersistentVolume` backed by an NFS server.
The PersistentVolume allows setting NFS mountOptions.
It creates a storage class that Posit Package Manager then takes advantage of when it creates its `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
Both the PVC and PV will be left around after the helm release is removed (for manual cleanup).

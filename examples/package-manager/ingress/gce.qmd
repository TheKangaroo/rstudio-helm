# Configuring Posit Package Manager with GCE Ingress

This example deploys Posit Package Manager with an Ingress using the GKE Ingress Controller to create a GCP Application Load Balancer.
This example is provided to show how to set annotations to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS and use GCP Certificate Manager if desired.

The GKE Ingress Controller has a variety of settings and modes of operation.
Please visit the GCP documentation for more details specific to your use case:
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/load-balance-ingress

The focus of this example is on GKE Ingress setup, however there are a few requirements to run Package Manager.
To use the example you will need a license file or key, a PostgreSQL database and either a ReadWriteMany POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage or S3.

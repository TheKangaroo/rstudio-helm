# Configuring Posit Connect with OIDC

This example deploys RStudio Connect using OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO for
authentication.

Users will be authenticated via SSO (using OIDC) and users will be created
in Connect upon first login or creation via the Connect API using certain
claims received from the IdP.

The focus of this example is on authentication configuration, however there
are a few requirements to run Connect.

To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany
POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage and a PostgreSQL database.

# Configuring Posit Connect with Custom Container Images

This example deploys Posit Connect using custom images instead of the default public Posit provided images.
There are a minimum of three images that Connect requires to function in Off-Host Execution mode include the Connect container, content container and content init container.
Additional content containers may be added to provide more R, Python and Quarto versions and other system dependencies.

The focus of this example is on using custom images, however there are a few requirements to run Connect.

To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage and a PostgreSQL database.

```{.yaml include="rstudio-connect-custom-image.yaml" filename="values.yaml"}
```

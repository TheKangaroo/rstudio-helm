{{- if hasKey .Values "config" }}
{{- if hasKey .Values.config "Licensing" }}
{{- if hasKey .Values.config.Licensing "LicenseType" }}

NOTE: `.Values.config.Licensing.LicenseType` is configured manually. Normally, we automatically configure this value:
  - When `license.server` is set, we set `LicenseType` to `remote`.
  - Otherwise, `LicenseType` uses the default of `local`.
Please consider removing this configuration value.

{{- if hasKey .Values.image "pullPolicy" }}

WARNING: `image.pullPolicy` value has been removed in chart version 0.2.7. Please change to `image.imagePullPolicy`
  - This was done for consistency with our other charts
  - It is also easier to remember since this is what the kubernetes value is actually called
  - See `NEWS.md` to note other changes between releases

{{- if hasKey .Values.pod "serviceAccountName" }}
NOTE: `pod.serviceAccountName` is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
Please use `serviceAccount.name` instead.

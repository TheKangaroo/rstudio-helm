# Configuring Posit Connect with Custom Container Images

This example deploys Posit Connect using custom images instead of the default public Posit provided images.

There are a minimum of three images that Connect requires to function in Off-Host Execution mode:

- include the Connect container
- the content container
- the `content-init` container
  
Additional content containers may be added to provide more R, Python and Quarto versions and other system dependencies.

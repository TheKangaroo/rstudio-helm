# Configuring Posit Workbench with additional volumes

This example shows how to mount an additional PVC to the Workbench and  the session pods. 
This pattern of specifying the volumes and volumeMounts will work for a variety of volume types: `PVC`, `ConfigMap`, etc.

Depending on the need to add additional volumes, you may only need to mount to Workbench or session pods but not both. 
For example, if you need to add TLS certificates for Workbench then the session pods do not need the volumes.

```{.yaml include="rstudio-workbench-with-additional-mounts.yaml" filename="values.yaml"}

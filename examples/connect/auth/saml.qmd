# Configuring Posit Connect with SAML

This example deploys RStudio Connect using SAML SSO for authentication.

Users will be authenticated via SSO (using SAML) and users will be createdin Connect upon first login or creation via the Connect API using certain attributes received from the IdP.

The focus of this example is on authentication configuration, however there are a few requirements to run Connect.

To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage and a PostgreSQL database.

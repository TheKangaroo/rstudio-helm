# Configuring Posit Connect with OpenID Connect

This example deploys Posit Connect using OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO for authentication.

Users will be authenticated via SSO (using OIDC) and then users will be created in Connect upon first login or upon creation via the Connect API. Connect will populate user information based on certain claims received from the IdP.

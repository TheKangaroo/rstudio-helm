# Configuring Posit Package Manager with Azure Application Gateway

This example deploys Posit Package Manager with an Ingress using the
Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller to create a
Azure Application Gateway load balancer.
This example is provided to show how to set annotations to redirect HTTP
traffic to HTTPS.
The Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller has a variety of settings 
and modes of operation. Please visit the Azure documentation for more details
specific to your use case:
https://azure.github.io/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/
The focus of this example is on an Azure Application Gateway setup,
however there are a few requirements to run Package manager.
To use the example you will need a license file or key,
a PostgreSQL database and either a ReadWriteMany
POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage or S3.

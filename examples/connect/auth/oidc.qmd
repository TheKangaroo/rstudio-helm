# Configuring Posit Connect with OIDC

This example deploys Posit Connect using OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO for
authentication.

Users will be authenticated via SSO (using OIDC) and users will be created
in Connect upon first login or creation via the Connect API using certain
claims received from the IdP.

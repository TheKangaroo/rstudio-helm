# Configuring Posit Workbench with SAML

This example deploys Posit Workbench using SAML for authentication and `sssd` for user provisioning.

Users will be authenticated via SSO (using SAML) and Workbench will match an attribute (`NameID` by default) to a Linux user account in the Workbench container.
`sssd` is already running in the Workbench container and can be used to automatically provision local user accounts using LDAP or Active Directory.

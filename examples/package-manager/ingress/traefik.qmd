# Configuring Posit Package Manager with Traefik Ingress

This example deploys RStudio Package Manager with an Ingress using the Traefik Ingress Controller.
The Traefik Ingress Controller has a variety of settings and modes of operation.

Please visit the Traefik documentation for more details specific to your use case:
https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/

The focus of this example is on Traefik Ingress setup, however there are a few requirements to run Package Manager.
To use the example you will need a license file or key, a PostgreSQL database and either a ReadWriteMany POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage or S3.

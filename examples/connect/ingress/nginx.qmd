# Configuring Posit Connect with NGINX Ingress

This example deploys Posit Connect with an Ingress using the Ingress NGINX Controller.
This example is provided to show how to set annotations to enabled session affinity and to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

The Ingress NGINX Controller has a variety of settings  and modes of operation.
[Please visit the NGINX controller documentation for more details:](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)


::: callout-note
This example is for the Ingress NGINX Controller which is part of Kubernetes. 
If you are using the NGINX or NGINX Plus Ingress Controllers from NGINX Inc located at https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress then different annotations will need to be applied.

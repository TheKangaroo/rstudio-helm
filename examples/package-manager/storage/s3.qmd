# Configuring Posit Package Manager with S3

This example deploys RStudio Package Manager using S3 instead of
a PV and PVC for sharedStorage.
The focus of this example is on using S3, however there
are a few requirements to run Package manager.
To use the example you will need a license file or key
and a PostgreSQL database.

```{.yaml include="rstudio-pm-with-s3.yaml" filename="values.yaml"}
```

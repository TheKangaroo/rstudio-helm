# Configuring Posit Package Manager with an NFS-backed PersistentVolume

This example deploys RStudio Package Manager with a single PersistentVolume backed by an NFS server.
The PersistentVolume allows setting NFS mountOptions.
It creates a storage class that RStudio Package Manager then takes advantage of when it creates its PersistentVolumeClaim.
Both the PVC and PV will be left around after the helm release is removed (for manual cleanup).

The focus of this example is on setting up a PV backed by NFS, however there are a few requirements to run Package Manager.
To use the example you will need a license file or key, a PostgreSQL database and either a ReadWriteMany POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage or S3.

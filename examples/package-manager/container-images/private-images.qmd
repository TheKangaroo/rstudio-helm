# Configuring Posit Package Manager to Access Authenticated Image Registries

This example deploys RStudio Package Manager using custom images in registries requiring authentication instead of the default public Posit provided images.

The image can be pulled from your own container registry instead of the public Posit provided image. 
This example shows where to provide private registry credentials in the form of a Kubernetes secret of type
`kubernetes.io/dockercfg`

The focus of this example is on using custom images in private registries, however there are a few requirements to run Package Manager.
To use the example you will need a license file or key, a PostgreSQL database and either a `ReadWriteMany` POSIX compliant storage class for `sharedStorage` or S3.

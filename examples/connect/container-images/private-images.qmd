# Configuring Posit Connect to Access Authenticated Image Registries

This example deploys Posit Connect using custom images in registries requiring authentication instead of the default public Posit provided images.
There are a minimum of three images that Connect requires to function in Off-Host Execution mode include the Connect container, content container and content init container. 
Additional content containers may be added to provide more R, Python and Quarto versions and other system dependencies.
These images can be pulled from your own container registry instead of the public Posit provided images. 
This example also shows where to provide private registry credentials in the form of a Kubernetes secret of type
`kubernetes.io/dockercfg`.

Note the registry credentials secret must be specified in two places in the values to apply to Connect, content and init containers (shown in the example below).
Also note the `launcher.templateValues.pod.imagePullSecrets` provides the pod-level `imagePullSecret` that provides the secret to pull the `launcher.defaultInitContainer` as well.
The focus of this example is on using custom images in private registries, however there are a few requirements to run Connect.
To use the example you will need a license file or key, a ReadWriteMany POSIX compliant storage class for sharedStorage and a PostgreSQL database.

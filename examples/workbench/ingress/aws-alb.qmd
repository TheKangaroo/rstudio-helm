# Configuring Posit Workbench with AWS ALB Ingress

This example deploys Posit Workbench with an Ingress using the AWS Load Balancer Controller to create an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
This example is provided to show how to set annotations to enabled session affinity, redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS and use AWS Certificate Manager if desired.
The AWS Load Balancer Controller has a variety of settings and modes of operation. Please visit the AWS documentation for more details specific to your use case:

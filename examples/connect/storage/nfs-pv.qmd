# Configuring Posit Connect with an NFS-backed PersistentVolume

This example deploys Posit Connect with a single PersistentVolume backed by an NFS server.
The `PersistentVolume` allows setting NFS `mountOptions`.
it creates a storage class that Posit Connect then takes advantage of when it creates its `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
Both the PVC and PV will be left around after the helm release is removed (for manual cleanup).

The focus of this example is on setting up a PV backed by NFS, however there are a few requirements to run Connect.
To use the example you will need a license file or key, a `ReadWriteMany` POSIX compliant storage class for `sharedStorage` and a PostgreSQL database.

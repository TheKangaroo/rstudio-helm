# Configuring Posit Package Manager with AWS ALB Ingress

This example deploys Posit Package Manager with an Ingress using the AWS Load Balancer Controller to create an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
This example is provided to show how to set annotations to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS and use AWS Certificate Manager if desired.

The AWS Load Balancer Controller has a variety of settings and modes of operation. 
[Please visit the AWS documentation for more details:](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/)

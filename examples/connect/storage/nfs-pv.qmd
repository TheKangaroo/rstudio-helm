# Configuring Posit Connect with an NFS-backed `PersistentVolume`

This example deploys Posit Connect with a single PersistentVolume backed by an NFS server.
The `PersistentVolume` allows setting NFS `mountOptions`.
it creates a storage class that Posit Connect then takes advantage of when it creates its `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
Both the PVC and PV will be left around after the helm release is removed (for manual cleanup).

# Configuring Posit Package Manager with Custom Container Images

This example deploys Posit Package Manager using a custom image instead of the default public Posit provided image.

The focus of this example is on using custom images, however there are a few requirements to run Package manager.
To use the example you will need a license file or key,a PostgreSQL database and either a `ReadWriteMany` POSIX compliant `StorageClass` for `sharedStorage` or S3.

```{.yaml include="rstudio-pm-custom-image.yaml" filename="values.yaml"}
```
